go to install directory of pyinstalller, make sure the folder 
contains file: pyinstaller.py(for my PC it's in c:/python27/pyinstaller)

Then input:
python pyinstaller.py -F c:\scripts\***.py

"***.py" is your script to be converted, "-F" means your want this to be a single file, otherwise you will get a folder.
