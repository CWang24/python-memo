go to install directory of pyinstalller, make sure the folder 
contains file: pyinstaller.py(for my PC it's in c:/python27/pyinstaller)

Then input:
python pyinstaller.py -F c:\scripts\***.py

"***.py" is your script to be converted, "-F" means your want this to be a single file, otherwise you will get a folder.

For install pyinstaller, please go to http://www.cnblogs.com/balian/archive/2012/11/21/2780503.html.

When I use pyinstaller to process my GUI made with wxPython, a console window always come along with the GUI I designed.
To suppress this console window or cmd window, after you took the step above, 
go to the project folder pyintaller created for your code 
and modify the ***.spec, make "console=False" instead of True as it was.
Then run the above step again while this time add -w, i.e.:
python pyinstaller.py -F -w c:\scripts\***.py
Done~

If you don't need your work to be an .exe, just modify ***.py to ***.pyw and done.
